## Getting and Cleaning Data Peer Assessment 

The **gettingandcleaningdata** folder of the [datasciencecoursera repo](https://github.com/lindauruchurtu/datasciencecoursera), contains an R script which generates
tidy datasets as established by the Getting and Cleaning Data Peer Assessment guidelines and a code book
in markdown format, expkaining variables, data and transformations that were performed to clean up the data.

* [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/lindauruchurtu/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/gettingandcleaningdata/run_analysis.R) is a script that downloads the data from the original source, unzips it and loads it into R. It then
cleans it and processes it to generate the required data sets.
* CodeBook.md is a markdown file describing the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data

The original data can be found in: [Original Data Set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
